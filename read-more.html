				Ensemble is an effort to combine the powers of Zend Framework 2 and the flexibility of generic reusable modules to give you a kick start in the creation of applications. Ensemble is called a content management framework, because Ensemble makes things easy to create cms based applications.

				Many applications require content management. While frameworks like the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/zf2">Zend Framework 2</a> make it easy to reuse low level components, many applications have a need for reusable higher level components too. This is what ensemble aims for: the tools will turn your application into a content management system without a hassle.

				The modules you write will provide the content. They hook into a routing process and you can be as flexible as you want with your controllers. If you need to manage the content, ensemble will hook that module into the admin interface too. From that interface it is extremely easy to keep your front office up to date.
